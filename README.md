# CMPM 121 D3 Project

This is the D3 demo project for the CMPM 121 course.

## How to Play

1. Move: Use the ↑ N, ↓ S, ← W, → E buttons in the top-left corner to move your player on the map.

2. Interact: The cells with a blue border around the player are within interaction range.

3. Collect: When your hand is empty (In hand: —), click a number within the interaction range to pick up that token.

4. Craft: When you are holding a token, click a token of the same value on the map to combine them into a new token of double the value.
